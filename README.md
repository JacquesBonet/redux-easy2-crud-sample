## Introduction

This project is an example of the use of the redux-easy2-crud library.

I have created a products actions file. This is not mandatory, you can use directly the redux-easy2-crud actions.

The middleware on the project is just for project sample. Is not mandatory to have a middleware when we use redux-easy2-crud actions

Check the size of the products reducer: one line of code!!!
