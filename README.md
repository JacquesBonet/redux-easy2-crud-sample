## Introduction

This project is an example of the use of the redux-easy2-crud library.

I have created a products actions file. This is not mandatory, you can use directly the redux-easy2-crud actions.

This sample use crudMiddleware middleware from readux_easy2-crud library.

The middleware BuyOneGetOneFree.js use on the project redux-easy2-crud-sample, is not related to crud application, but just another sample middleware to illustrate how associate two unrelated middlewares.

Check the size of the products reducer: one line of code!!!
